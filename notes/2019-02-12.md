## SoC Week 2:Day 2 Notes

### JSON- JavaScript Object Notation

Very similar notation to a normal array, other than the fact that the key is a string. e.g.

Javascript object:
`newObject = { name: "Matthew" }`
s
JSON Object:
`newJsonObject = { "name":"Matthew"; }`

You can use JSON.stringify to change a javascript object into a JSON object:

`let jsonObject = JSON.stringify(newObject)`:
`"{"name":"Matthew"}"`

You can then change this back into a Javascript object with:

`JSON.parse(jsonObject)`:
`{name: "Matthew"}`

#### Fetch API

### Example API's

[Star Wars](https://swapi.co/) 

[Dad Jokes](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api)

[The Simpsons](https://thesimpsonsquoteapi.glitch.me/)

This is a simple way of handling the 'fetching' of objects.

It takes a string- the url where you are getting the information from. It then sends something back, and then finally we can do something with the JSON.

`fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1') .then(function)`

By default fetch is a GET request, but you can send a second argument that you think the server will need:

`var options = {method:"GET"}; fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', options)`

### Clock App

transform: rotate(0deg), transform-origin:

myDate method has other methods such as myDate.getHours() and myDate.getMinutes()
